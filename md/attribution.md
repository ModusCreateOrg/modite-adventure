## Sound Effects
The sound effects in Modite Adventure are mainly sourced from the [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org) [The Essential Retro Video Game Sound Effects Collection \[512 sounds\].zip](https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style) pack ([License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)). We also did some ad-hoc recording and mashing up of some of the SFX to give the game some unique flavor.

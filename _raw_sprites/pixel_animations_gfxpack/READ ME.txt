-=-=-

This collection of animations is full of retro charm! With a clean oldschool style, these animations will find a home in any pixel art project. 
Includes animations for sword slashes, weapon impacts, smoke and dust effects, all sorts of elemental magical spells, and more!

Thank you for downloading this graphics package.

This is a stand-alone graphics pack, but designed to be compatible with any pixel art style -- including my Time Fantasy RPG asset series.

The primary goal of these animations is flexibility: 
Weapon animations are designed for use in traditional RPG battles as well as action-RPG combat. Frames can be flipped or rotated for further variety of application.
Impact and effect animations, such as the smoke or dust clouds, should have a wide variety of uses, including as environmental detail.
Some parts of animations can be used in combinations with other animations. Some animations can loop infinitely -- hopefully it's clear which ones are capable of this.

Included:
 - Animation Sheets (100%)
 - Animation Sheets for RPG Maker MV
 - Individual Frames
